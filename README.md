This script helps you backup your [RoamResearch](https://roamresearch.com/) graphs!

This script automatically
- Downloads a **markdown archive** of your RoamResearch workspace
- Downloads a **json archive** of your RoamResearch workspace
- Download the full **EDN** of your RoamResearch workspace
- Unzips them to your git directory
- Format your markdown, including with **backlinks**
- **Commits and push** the difference to GitHub

# What's new

**V.02:** 
- Use Selenium library, and roam-to-git seems to be much faster and stable ðŸ”¥
- Download the EDN archive

# Demo
[See it in action!](https://github.com/caffo/roam-to-git-demo). This repo is updated using roam-to-git.

# Why to use it

- You have a **backup** if RoamResearch loses some of your data.
- You have a **history** of your notes.
- You can **browse** your GitHub repository easily with a mobile device


# Use it with GitHub Actions (recommended)

**Note**: [Erik Newhard's guide](https://eriknewhard.com/blog/backup-roam-in-github) shows an easy way of setting up GitHub Actions without using the CLI.

##  Create a (private) GitHub repository for all your notes

With [gh](https://github.com/cli/cli): `gh repo create notes` (yes, it's private)

Or [manually](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo)

## Configure GitHub secrets 

- Go to github.com/your/repository/settings/secrets 


##### Regarding Google Account Authorization

Due to the limitations of OAuth and complexities with tokens, we are unable to snapshot accounts that are set up with the *Login with Google* option as of now.

To set up backup in this case, you will need to *create*(not exactly) a native account from your old Google Account, which is as simple as using the reset password link found in Roam.

Once you've reset your password, use the following steps to finish setting up your backup!


### Configuring GitHub Secrets

Add 3 (separate) secrets where the names are 

`ROAMRESEARCH_USER`

`ROAMRESEARCH_PASSWORD`

`ROAMRESEARCH_DATABASE`

- Refer to [env.template](env.template) for more information

- when inserting the information, there is no need for quotations or assignments

## Add GitHub action

```
cd notes
mkdir -p .github/workflows/
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caffo/roam-to-git-demo/master/.github/workflows/main.yml > \
    .github/workflows/main.yml
git add .github/workflows/main.yml
git commit -m "Add github/workflows/main.yml"
git push --set-upstream origin master
```

## Check that the GitHub Action works

- Go to github.com/your/repository/actions
- Your CI job should start in a few seconds

### Note:

If the backup does not automatically start, try pushing to the repository again

# Use it locally

**Note**: if your file system is not case-sensitive, you will not backup notes that have the same name in different 
cases

## Install Roam-To-Git
With [pipx](https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx) 
(if you don't know pipx, you should look at it, it's wonderful!)

`pipx install git+https://github.com/caffo/roam-to-git.git`

## Create a (private) GitHub repository for all your notes

With [gh](https://github.com/cli/cli): `gh repo create notes` (yes, it's private)

Or [manually](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo)

Then run `git push --set-upstream origin master`

## Configure environment variables

- `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caffo/roam-to-git/master/env.template > notes/.env`
- Fill the .env file: `vi .env`
- Ignore it: `echo .env > notes/.gitignore; cd notes; git add .gitignore; git commit -m "Initial commit"`

## Manual backup

- Run the script: `roam-to-git notes/`
- Check your GitHub repository, it should be filled with your notes :)

## Automatic backup

One-liner to run it with a [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) every hour: 
`echo "0 *  *  *  *  '$(which roam-to-git)' '$(pwd)/notes'" | crontab -`

NB: there are [issues](https://github.com/MatthieuBizien/roam-to-git/issues/43) on Mac with a crontab.

# Debug

Making `roam-to-git` foolproof is hard, as it depends on Roam, on GitHub Action or the local environment, 
on software not very stable (`pyppeteer` we still love you ðŸ˜‰ )
and on the correct user configuration.

For debugging, please try the following:

- Check that the environment variables `ROAMRESEARCH_USER`, `ROAMRESEARCH_PASSWORD`, `ROAMRESEARCH_DATABASE` are correctly setup
- Login into Roam using the username and the password. 
You may want to ask a new password if you have enabled Google Login, as it solved some user problems.
- Run `roam-to-git --debug` to check the authentication and download work
- Look at the traceback
- Look for similar issues
- If nothing else work, create a new issue with as many details as possible. 
I will try my best to understand and help you, no SLA promised ðŸ˜‡
