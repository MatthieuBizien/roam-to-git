This script helps you backup your [RoamResearch](https://roamresearch.com/) graphs!

This script automatically
- Downloads a **markdown archive** of your RoamResearch workspace
- Downloads a **json archive** of your RoamResearch workspace
- Download the full **EDN** of your RoamResearch workspace
- Unzips them to your git directory
- Format your markdown, including with **backlinks**
- **Commits and push** the difference to Github

# What's new

**V.02:** 
- Use Selenium library, and roam-to-git seems to be much faster and stable ðŸ”¥
- Download the EDN archive

# Demo
[See it in action!](https://github.com/MatthieuBizien/roam-to-git-demo). This repo is updated using roam-to-git.

ðŸš€ðŸš€ **NEW** ðŸš€ðŸš€ : The [Unofficial backup](https://github.com/MatthieuBizien/RoamResearch-offical-help/) 
of the official [RoamResearch Help Database](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/help)

# Why to use it

- You have a **backup** if RoamResearch loses some of your data.
- You have a **history** of your notes.
- You can **browse** your Github repository easily with a mobile device


# Use it with Github Actions (recommended)

**Note**: [Erik Newhard's guide](https://eriknewhard.com/blog/backup-roam-in-github) shows an easy way of setting up Github Actions without using the CLI.

##  Create a (private) Github repository for all your notes

With [gh](https://github.com/cli/cli): `gh repo create notes` (yes, it's private)

Or [manually](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo)

## Configure Github secrets 

- Go to github.com/your/repository/settings/secrets 


##### Regarding Google Account Authorization

Due to the limitations of OAuth and complexities with tokens, we are unable to snapshot accounts that are set up with the *Login with Google* option as of now.

To set up backup in this case, you will need to *create*(not exactly) a native account from your old Google Account, which is as simple as using the reset password link found in Roam. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46789005/99179188-24482f00-2741-11eb-9c24-df7bb8707709.png)

Once you've reset your password, use the following steps to finish setting up your backup!


### Configuring Github Secrets

Add 3 (separate) secrets where the names are 

`ROAMRESEARCH_USER`

`ROAMRESEARCH_PASSWORD`

`ROAMRESEARCH_DATABASE`

- Refer to [env.template](env.template) for more information

- when inserting the information, there is no need for quotations or assignments

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/173090/90904133-2cf1c900-e3cf-11ea-960d-71d0543b8158.png)


## Add GitHub action

```
cd notes
mkdir -p .github/workflows/
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MatthieuBizien/roam-to-git-demo/master/.github/workflows/main.yml > \
    .github/workflows/main.yml
git add .github/workflows/main.yml
git commit -m "Add github/workflows/main.yml"
git push --set-upstream origin master
```

## Check that the Github Action works

- Go to github.com/your/repository/actions
- Your CI job should start in a few seconds

### Note:

If the backup does not automatically start, try pushing to the repository again

# Use with GitLab CI

This section is based on this article on GitLab blog:
https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2017/11/02/automating-boring-git-operations-gitlab-ci/

## Create a project

Create a project for your notes. We will refer to it as
`YOUR_USER/YOUR_PROJECT`.

## Create key pair for pushing commits

Generate a new key pair that will be used by the CI job to push the new commits.

```bash
$ ssh-keygen -f gitlab-ci-commit
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in gitlab-ci-commit-test
Your public key has been saved in gitlab-ci-commit-test.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:HoQUcbUPJU2Ur78EineqA6IVljk8ZD9XIxiGFUrBues agentydragon@pop-os
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 3072]----+
|   .o=O*..o++.   |
|   .*+.o. o+o    |
|   +.=. .oo. .   |
|    X o..  o  .  |
|   . = oS   o.   |
|    + .. o ...   |
|   + . .o o ...  |
|  . E   .. o ..  |
|        .o.   .. |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

DO NOT commit the private key (`gitlab-ci-commit`).

## Add the public key as a deploy key

This step allows the CI job to push when identified by the public key.

Go to Project Settings &rarr; Repository (`https://gitlab.com/YOUR_USER/YOUR_PROJECT/-/settings/repository`) &rarr; Deploy Keys.

Paste the content of the public key file (`gitlab-ci-commit-test.pub`), and
enable write access for the public key.

![](img/gitlab-add-key.png)

Click "Add Key".

## Add the private key as a CI variable

This step gives the CI job the private key so it can authenticate against
GitLab.

Go to Project Settings &rarr; Pipelines (`https://gitlab.com/YOUR_USER/YOUR_PROJECT/-/settings/ci_cd`) &rarr; Variables.

Click "Add variable", with name `GIT_SSH_PRIV_KEY`, and paste in the content
of the private key file (`gitlab-ci-commit`). You probably want to mark
"Protect". You might want to look up GitLab docs on protected branches.

![](img/gitlab-add-variable.png)

Click "Add variable".

Also add the following variables with appropriate values:

* `ROAMRESEARCH_USER`
* `ROAMRESEARCH_PASSWORD`
* `ROAMRESEARCH_DATABASE`

## Create a `gitlab_known_hosts` file

In your repo, create and commit a `gitlab_known_hosts` file containing the
needed SSH `known_hosts` entry/entries for the GitLab instance. It will be used
by the CI job to check that it's talking to the right server.

This should work as of 2021-01-04:

```
# Generated by @agentydragon at 2021-01-04 at by `git fetch`ing a GitLab repo
# with an empty ~/.ssh/known_hosts file.

```

## Create `.gitlab-ci.yml`

Create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

```yaml
backup:
  when: manual
  before_script:
    - 'which ssh-agent || ( apt-get update -y && apt-get install openssh-client -y )'
    - eval $(ssh-agent -s)
    - ssh-add <(echo "$GIT_SSH_PRIV_KEY")
    - git config --global user.email "roam-to-git@example.org"
    - git config --global user.name "roam-to-git automated backup"
    - mkdir -p ~/.ssh
    - cat gitlab_known_hosts >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts

    # (Taken from: https://github.com/buildkite/docker-puppeteer/blob/master/Dockerfile)
    # We install Chrome to get all the OS level dependencies, but Chrome itself
    # is not actually used as it's packaged in the pyppeteer library.
    # Alternatively, we could could include the entire dep list ourselves
    # (https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/troubleshooting.md#chrome-headless-doesnt-launch-on-unix)
    # but that seems too easy to get out of date.
    - apt-get install -y wget gnupg ca-certificates
    - wget -q -O - https://dl-ssl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub | apt-key add -
    - echo "deb [arch=amd64] http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/ stable main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google.list
    - apt-get update
    - apt-get install google-chrome-stable libxss1 python3-pip -y

    - pip3 install git+https://github.com/MatthieuBizien/roam-to-git.git

    # TODO(agentydragon): Create and publish Docker image with all deps already
    # installed.
  script:
    # Need to clone the repo again over SSH, since by default GitLab clones
    # the repo for CI over HTTPS, for which we cannot authenticate pushes via
    # pubkey.
    - git clone --depth=1 git@gitlab.com:YOUR_USER/YOUR_PROJECT
    - cd YOUR_PROJECT

    # --no-sandbox needed because Chrome refuses to run as root without it.
    - roam-to-git --browser-arg=--no-sandbox .
```

Commit and push.

## To run the pipeline

Go to `https://gitlab.com/YOUR_USER/YOUR_PROJECT/-/jobs`,
press the Play button:

![](img/gitlab-start-job.png)

Shortly after you should see an automated commit added to master.

![](img/gitlab-done.png)

## Scheduled backups

To run the script, say, every hour, go to the project's
CI / CD &rarr; Schedules (`https://gitlab.com/YOUR_USER/YOUR_PROJECT/-/pipeline_schedules`).
Click "New schedule", fill out and submit (like this for every 15 minutes):

![](img/gitlab-schedule.png)

# Use it locally

**Note**: if your file system is not case-sensitive, you will not backup notes that have the same name in different 
cases

## Install Roam-To-Git
With [pipx](https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx) 
(if you don't know pipx, you should look at it, it's wonderful!)

`pipx install git+https://github.com/MatthieuBizien/roam-to-git.git`

## Create a (private) Github repository for all your notes

With [gh](https://github.com/cli/cli): `gh repo create notes` (yes, it's private)

Or [manually](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo)

Then run `git push --set-upstream origin master`

## Configure environment variables

- `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MatthieuBizien/roam-to-git/master/env.template > notes/.env`
- Fill the .env file: `vi .env`
- Ignore it: `echo .env > notes/.gitignore; cd notes; git add .gitignore; git commit -m "Initial commit"`

## Manual backup

- Run the script: `roam-to-git notes/`
- Check your Github repository, it should be filled with your notes :)

## Automatic backup

One-liner to run it with a [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) every hours: 
`echo "0 *  *  *  *  '$(which roam-to-git)' '$(pwd)/notes'" | crontab -`

NB: there are [issues](https://github.com/MatthieuBizien/roam-to-git/issues/43) on Mac with a crontab.

# Debug

Making `roam-to-git` foolproof is hard, as it depends on Roam, on Github Action or the local environment, 
on software not very stable (`pyppeteer` we still love you ðŸ˜‰ )
and on the correct user configuration.

For debugging, please try the following:

- Check that the environment variables `ROAMRESEARCH_USER`, `ROAMRESEARCH_PASSWORD`, `ROAMRESEARCH_DATABASE` are correctly setup
- Login into Roam using the username and the password. 
You may want to ask a new password if you have enabled Google Login, as it solved some user problems.
- Run `roam-to-git --debug` to check the authentification and download work
- Look at the traceback
- Look for similar issues
- If nothing else work, create a new issue with as many details as possible. 
I will try my best to understand and help you, no SLA promised ðŸ˜‡
